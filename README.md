# 🚑 WHisper AI

Multi-agent AI system to support frontline workers and citizens, built with **Google's Gemini models**, the **AI Developer Kit (ADK)**, and **Google Cloud Functions**.  
Citizens interact via **WhatsApp**, and the system intelligently triages, guides, books services, and provides follow-ups — while gracefully falling back to a **degraded lightweight mode** when resources are constrained.

## 📌 Problem
Frontline workers (triage nurses, emergency officers, council staff) and citizens face:
- Long queues
- Unclear protocols
- Overwhelmed staff
- Confused citizens who don’t know where to go

---

## 🎯 Challenge
Build a **multi-agent AI system** that bridges this gap:
- Citizens access the system via WhatsApp
- A Google Cloud Function orchestrates the workflow using Gemini + ADK
- Degraded mode ensures resilience under resource constraints
